# FIRE-ALERT-AND-ALARM-SYSTEM
This is my project "FIRE ALERT AND ALARM SYSTEM" ,The project is built around an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which serves as the brain of the system. It receives input signals from a temperature sensor (DHT11 or TMP36) and a flame sensor, processes the data, and triggers a buzzer and LED indicators when a potential fire is detected. The LCD display provides real-time updates of the temperature and system status.


 The implementation of the project and working model have been done through Tinkercad ,  the tinkercad link of this project is given below:
